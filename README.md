# Bad Habits

Category: Sport & Health

Create a counter for each habit that you are trying to get rid of. If you are trying to quit smoking, create a counter and set the last time you had a cigarette. The app will show you how long it’s been since you smoked for the last time. Tracking your progress will help you stay motivated.


Whenever you want to smoke again, open the app and check your progress. You can receive rewards in the app for not smoking again.


You don’t want to reset that counter, do you?
